### **Problem Statement**
<div align="justify"> 


In an increasingly competitive gaming industry, understanding players’ preferences and expectations is critical for game publishers, such as Rockstar Games, to ensure successful future game releases. This project seeks to gather insights on players' demographics, gaming habits, and preferences, including genre, platform, and pricing willingness, to inform the development of Rockstar Games' next title. This survey will analyze user preferences to identify the most engaging game features, genre appeal, and user feedback on existing titles, helping Rockstar Games align their game design, pricing strategies, and platform support with audience expectations.

The primary goal is to leverage insights from this survey to:
1. **Identify Target Demographics**: Understand the age, gender, geographic distribution, and gaming frequency of Rockstar Games' core audience.
3. **Gauge Platform and Genre Preferences**: Discover players' preferred platforms and genres, enabling Rockstar Games to tailor their next title accordingly.
4. **Establish Pricing Sensitivity**: Determine the average price range players are willing to pay, guiding Rockstar Games in establishing a price point that maximizes sales.
5. **Analyze Gameplay Motivations**: Understand the purposes and motivations behind gameplay, such as entertainment, relaxation, or social engagement.
6. **Assess Features and Feedback on Previous Titles**: Compile user feedback on the features players particularly liked or disliked, helping refine development priorities for the next title.

### Data Cleaning and Processing

<div align="justify"> 

- **Data Cleaning and Column Removal**:  
  - Removed automatically generated columns: **ID, Start Time, Completion, Email, and Name**.  
  - These columns were administrative and did not add value to the analysis.

- **Handling Empty Data Cells**:  
  - Survey design included an early termination question, “**Do you play games?**”  
  - If respondents answered “No,” the survey ended, leaving remaining questions unanswered (i.e., empty cells).
  - Retaining these empty cells preserves responses to this critical question, allowing for accurate analysis of respondents who do not play games.

- **Approach to Missing Data in Analysis**:  
  - Empty cells are not removed, as this would erase entire records of certain respondents.
  - Instead, **empty data is selectively hidden** in specific analyses to maintain clarity and focus.

- **Dashboard Reflection**:  
  - The dashboard incorporates this strategy, displaying only relevant data points for a more accurate and insightful analysis.

### Data Insights
<div align="justify"> 
  
- **Regional and Age Analysis**:  
  - Asia and North America have the largest gaming populations, with the **17–24 age group** being the dominant player demographic on both continents.

- **Preference for Free vs. Paid Games**:  
  - **72%** of gamers prefer **free games**, while **62%** are willing to purchase games, indicating a trend toward cost-free gaming experiences with a substantial segment still opting to buy.

- **Gender Insights**:  
  - Data shows that **men play more games than women**, as reflected in the dashboard.

- **Platform Spending Trends**:  
  - **PC games** attract a broad range of spending, with users showing varied price flexibility. **PlayStation** ranks as the next popular choice for paid games.

- **Gaming Time and Purpose**:  
  - **Less than 3 hours** of daily gaming is primarily associated with **entertainment and relaxation**.
  - Those playing **4 to 5 hours daily** often do so for **stress relief**.
  - Gaming sessions extending **over 6 hours daily** suggest a habit of **passing the time** or filling idle hours.

</div>

### **Recommendations**

<div align="justify"> 

1. **Developing Free-to-Play Models with Paid Enhancements**:  
   - With **72% of players preferring free games**, Rockstar Games should explore free-to-play models, incorporating optional in-game purchases, expansions, or premium features. This approach can attract more players while monetizing through microtransactions for those willing to spend.

2. **Targeting the 17–24 Age Group in Asia and North America**:  
   - Since the **17–24 age bracket dominates the gaming population in Asia and North America**, Rockstar could tailor content, marketing strategies, and in-game events to appeal to the preferences and gaming styles of this group. Partnering with regional influencers and using social media campaigns could help reach this audience effectively.

3. **Platform-Specific Content and Pricing**:  
   - Given the flexibility in spending for **PC games** and strong popularity of **PlayStation**, Rockstar should consider differentiated content for these platforms. Pricing strategies could reflect platform trends, such as offering bundled discounts or early access content for certain platforms.

4. **Game Design for Different Playtime Purposes**:  
   - **Under-3-hour players** seek quick, engaging gameplay, while **4-5-hour players** often view gaming as stress relief. Including short, engaging missions alongside longer, more immersive experiences can meet both casual and dedicated players’ needs.
   - For players gaming **6+ hours a day**, Rockstar could introduce sandbox or open-world elements that allow for continuous, exploratory gameplay without specific objectives, catering to players looking to "kill time."

5. **Addressing Gender Differences in Gaming**:  
   - Since men currently represent a higher proportion of players, creating gender-inclusive marketing and considering character diversity may broaden the appeal across genders, encouraging more balanced engagement.

</div>

### **Conclusion**

<div align="justify"> 
  This analysis highlights the importance of player demographics, platform preferences, gaming motivations, and spending behaviors in shaping game design and marketing strategies. By recognizing the appeal of free games, the dominance of younger age groups, and varied playtime motivations, Rockstar Games can refine its approach to meet players’ evolving expectations. Adapting to these insights will enable Rockstar to not only strengthen its market position but also enhance player satisfaction and engagement with future game titles. These recommendations serve as strategic actions to attract new players and retain existing ones, ultimately driving Rockstar Games’ long-term growth in a competitive industry.
